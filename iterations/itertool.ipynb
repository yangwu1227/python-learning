    "1. We need to understand that the job of the `while` loop is to increment the `indices` one after the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The job of the `for i in reversed(range(r))` loop, where `list(reversed(range(r))) = [1, 0]`, is to ensure that we do not over-increment any of values in `[0, 1]`. What the loop precisely makes sure is that:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    - The value of `indices[i] = indices[r - 1]` cannot be greater than `n - 1`. This is because `r` (the number of objects to choose) cannot be greater than `n` (the largest possible number of objects to choose from). In our case, the largest index `1` in `[0, 1]` cannot exceed the largest possible index `2` in `0, 1, 2` where `n = 3`. In the general case, we obtain this largest possible index (the upper limit) using `n - 1` since python counts from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The value of `indices[i] = indices[r - 2]` cannot be greater than `n - 2`. In our case, the second largest index `0` in `[0, 1]` cannot exceed the second largest possible index `1` in `0, 1, 2`. In the general case, we obtain this second largest possible index using `n - 2`. The reasoning is the same: if we are to choose `r = 1` objects from among `n = 2` possible objects, the value `indices[r - 2] = [0, 1][0] = 0` cannot be greater than the largest index in `0, 1`, which is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the general case, we have `indices[r - k] < n - k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Put another way, `n - 1` is upper limit (not inclusive) for incrementing the index `indices[r - 1]`; in our case, `2 (n - 1) > 1 (r - 1)` so we can increment `1` by 1 to get `2`. Then, `n - 2` is the upper limit (not inclusive) for incrementing the second index `indices[r - 2]`; again, in our case, `1 (n - 2) > 0 (r - 2)`, so we can increment `0` by 1 to get `1`. This same patterns continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The looping variable `i` goes from `r - 1, r - 2, ..., r - k, ..., 2, 1,  0`, or `[1, 0]` in this case, we can substitute the `r - k` with `i` in the general equation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "r - k &= i \\\\\n",
    "- k &= i - r \\\\\n",
    "k & = -i + r \\\\ \n",
    "k & = r - i\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The general case then becomes `indices[i] < n - (r - i)` $\\rightarrow$ `indices[i] < n - r + i`. The official python example uses `indices[i] != i + n - r`, which accomplishes the same thing. When `indices[i] == i + n - r` is `True`, it effectively covers all the cases where the limit `indices[i] < n - r + i` is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If `indices[i] != i + n - r` is `True`, it effectively means that we can safely increment `indices[i]` by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The loop `for j in range(i+1, r): indices[j] = indices[j-1] + 1` ensures that every time we increment an `indices[i]`, we set the indexes after `indices[i]` to their smallest possible values. This prevents us from missing out on any combination. For instance, suppose we have `(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)` as the iterable, `r = 3`, and the combination indices `[0, 2, 4]`. When we increment 2 to 3, the last index will be 4, in which case we would miss out on the `[0, 2, 3]` combination. But if we update the latter indices based on that the previous by incrementing 2 by 1 and assigning that value as the last index of `[0, 2, 4]` $\\rightarrow$ `[0, 2, 3]`, we effectively address the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Lastly, `tuple(pool[i] for i in indices)` simply yields the combination of each specific iteration of the `while` loop."
